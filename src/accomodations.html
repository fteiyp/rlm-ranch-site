    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      There are three large bedrooms in the main section of the house and two
      additional bedrooms in a second wing. The three bedrooms in the main
      section of the house each come with a private bathroom. Two of these
      bedrooms have king beds (convertible to 4 single beds upon request), the
      third bedroom has a queen bed. The second wing of the house is
      automatically included for groups of more than 6, or when specifically
      requested. It includes a bedroom with a king sized bed, a second bedroom
      with two single beds, a large shared bathroom, a common area with a
      wood-burning stove and queen size pull-out sofa bed, and two semi-private
      porch areas.
